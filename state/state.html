</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of State leads America&rsquo;s foreign policy through diplomacy, advocacy, and assistance by advancing the interests of the American people, their safety and economic prosperity.
</p>
      <h2 id="section-heading-h2">USAID Mission</h2>
      <p>On behalf of the American people, we promote and demonstrate democratic values abroad, and advance a free, peaceful, and prosperous world.
</p>
<p>In support of America&apos;s foreign policy, the U.S. Agency for International Development leads the U.S. Government&apos;s international development and disaster assistance through partnerships and investments that save lives, reduce poverty, strengthen democratic governance, and help people emerge from humanitarian crises and progress beyond assistance.
</p>

      <h2 id="section-heading-h2">Overview</h2>
      <p>The Department of State is the lead U.S. foreign affairs agency within the Executive Branch and the lead institution to conduct American diplomacy.  Established by Congress in 1789 and headquartered in Washington, D.C., the Department is the oldest and most senior executive agency of the U.S. Government.  The head of the Department, the Secretary of State, is the President&rsquo;s principal foreign policy advisor.  The Secretary implements the President&rsquo;s foreign policies worldwide through the Department and its employees.  The Department of State protects and advances the interests of American citizens and America&rsquo;s sovereignty by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Leading and uniting the free world around American values to uphold liberty;</li>
          <li>Strengthening our allies and alliances;</li>
            <li>Deepening our security relationships and partnerships around the world;</li>
            <li>Countering threats and adversaries;</li>
            <li>Creating enduring advantages at home by opening markets abroad;</li>
            <li>Helping developing nations establish investment and export opportunities for American businesses; and</li>
            <li>Preserving peace through international cooperation on global security challenges such as nuclear proliferation, terrorism, human trafficking, and the spread of pandemics (including HIV), humanitarian crises, and narcotics trafficking.</li>
           </ul>
           <p> As the U.S. Government&rsquo;s lead international development and humanitarian assistance agency, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) helps societies realize their potential.  USAID plans its development and assistance programs in coordination with the Department of State and collaborates with other U.S. government agencies, multilateral and bilateral organizations, private companies, academic institutions, faith-based groups, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  The Secretary of State and USAID Administrator are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
           <p>As the world&rsquo;s premier international development agency and a catalytic actor driving development results, USAID supports U.S. national security and economic prosperity, demonstrates American generosity, and promotes a path to self-reliance and resilience.  USAID plays a critical role in our nation&rsquo;s efforts to ensure stability, prevent conflict and build citizen-responsive local governance.  Through the Agency&rsquo;s work and that of its partner organizations, development assistance from the American people is transforming lives, communities, and economies around the world.  USAID&rsquo;s investments in evidence-based programs are: </p>
           <ul>
             <li>Providing humanitarian assistance -- with relief that is timely and effective in response to disasters and complex crises;</li>
             <li>Promoting global health -- through activities that save lives and protect Americans at home and abroad;</li>
             <li>Supporting global stability -- work that advances democracy and good governance, and helps to promote sustainable development, economic growth, and peace;</li>
             <li>Catalyzing innovation and partnership -- by identifying new and innovative ways to engage with the private sector; and</li>
             <li>Empowering women and girls and protecting life -- through support for women&rsquo;s equal access to opportunities and implementation of the &ldquo;Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance&rdquo; policy.</li>
           </ul>
        <!--   <p>The Department of State and USAID are pleased to provide this <em>Joint Strategic Plan</em> (JSP) for Fiscal Years (FY) 2018 to 2022, which sets forth the Secretary of State’s and USAID Administrator’s vision and direction for both organizations in the coming years. </p>
<p> The JSP supports the policy positions set forth by President Trump in the <em>National Security Strategy</em> and presents how the Department and USAID will implement U.S. foreign policy and development assistance.</p>
<p> The JSP will be used by the Department and USAID as a management tool to define success in international diplomacy and development, and as the foundation against which we will measure progress made towards the goals and objectives set forth herein.  The JSP is also the guiding document for the development of all bureau and mission strategic plans for FY 2018-2022. </p>

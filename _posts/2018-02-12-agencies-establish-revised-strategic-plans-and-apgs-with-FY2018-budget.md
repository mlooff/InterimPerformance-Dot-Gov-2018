Federal agencies today published updated Strategic Plans spanning 2018-2022, and established Agency Priority Goals (APGs) to be achieved over the course of 2018-2019. Set at the beginning of each new term of an Administration, the Agency Strategic Plan defines the agency’s mission, presents the long-term goals objectives an agency hopes to accomplish, strategies planned, and the approaches it will use to monitor its progress in addressing specific national problems, needs, challenges, and opportunities related to its mission.

A goal accountability structure of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, agency leaders set approximately 4 to 5 APGs every two years. These goals reflect the top priorities of Agency leadership, are aligned with the Administration’s priorities, results-oriented, implementation-focused, and measurable. Per the GPRA Modernization Act, Agency Chief Operating Officers or Deputy Secretaries regularly review progress towards achieving their APGs with quarterly performance updates posted to this site.

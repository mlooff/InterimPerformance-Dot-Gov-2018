Kansas City, MO – Today, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) kicked off a two-day listening tour to engage federal workers and citizens in discussions about improving government services. Hosting several events in the greater Kansas City area, which is home to nearly 50,000 federal employees, the listening tour was led by OMB’s Deputy Director of Management Margaret Weichert, and federal leaders, Government Services Administration (GSA) Administrator Emily Murphy, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Dr. Jeff Pon and Federal Chief Information Officer Suzette Kent.

In addition to the tour, Ms. Weichert unveiled the [President’s Management Agenda (PMA)](https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html), the Administration’s strategy and long-term vision for modernizing the federal government. Through holistic efforts, the PMA focuses on better supporting three key areas of mission, service, and stewardship of government resources. PMA implementation will drive change through modern information technology, data accountability and transparency, and a modern workforce.

We know that the public is frustrated with government’s perceived inability to deliver quality services for the American people,” said Ms. Weichert. “Through the President’s Management Agenda, this Administration is showing its commitment to modernizing Government, eliminating antiquated processes. This listening tour reflects the Administration’s understanding that transformational change starts with listening to citizens and agencies and aligning government services to meet those 21st century needs.”

For the first time, the President’s Management Agenda was presented outside of Washington, D.C. Kansas City was chosen because it is home to a large federal workforce and is an important hub of future federal innovation. Click here to view a replay of the event.

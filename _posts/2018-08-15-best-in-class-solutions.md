Best-in-Class (BIC) solutions reduce the amount of effort individual buyers spend finding and researching acquisitions solutions. BIC solutions are designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as government-wide solutions that:
- Allow acquisition experts to take advantage of pre-vetted, government-wide contract solutions;
- Support a government-wide migration to solutions that are mature and market-proven;
- Assist in the optimization of spending, within the government-wide category management framework; and
- Increase the transactional data available for agency level and government-wide analysis of buying behavior.

With guidance from GSA’s Category Management Program Management Office, BIC Solutions Owners developed Value Proposition Fact Sheets that describe their products or services with highlights about the solution’s benefits including small business participation, customer experiences, cost avoidance and other administrative savings as well as those provisions that can assist agencies in meeting the goals of the President’s Management Agenda.

The established goal for FY2018 is to increase the use of BICs to 35% or $20.3 billion. In FY2018, BIC solutions have already saved $5.1 billion. The Value Proposition Fact Sheets are available on the Federal and public sides of the Acquisition Gateway on the Best in Class Resource Page under “How Can BIC Meet My Requirements.”

<p>More than 200 federal C-suite leaders gathered in early April to better understand the <a href="http://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html">President’s Management Agenda (PMA)</a> and how they can individually and collectively move it forward. Event participants included leaders for six of the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals that drive implementation of the PMA.</p>
<p>“The President’s Management Agenda sets out a roadmap for the way ahead. It’s an important step forward along this path because we don’t accomplish anything without leadership’s buy-in and engagement,” said Karen Dunn Kelley, who leads a CAP goal focused on “Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset.”</p>
<p>Kelley underscored the importance of the CAP goal leaders’ roles. “We come from very diverse organizations with different missions, but taken together it is us that the American people rely on to deliver the critical missions of the federal government, provide excellent customer service, and manage our precious tax dollars.”</p>

<p>Federal agencies released today their implementation action plans and first progress updates on their fiscal year (FY) 2018-19 Agency Priority Goals (APG). The quarterly updates focus on the progress agencies made during the first quarter (Q1) of FY 2018, detailing their achievements while also identifying barriers and necessary changes to implementation strategies to achieve goal outcomes.
</p>
<p>Federal  agencies established the FY2018-19 APGs with the President's FY 2019 Budget. Agency leaders from major Federal agencies set APGs every two years, identify responsible officials for goal achievement, and review performance on a quarterly basis. APGs bring focus to mission areas where agencies need to drive significant progress and change. APGs are outcome-oriented, ambitious, and measurable with specific targets set that reflect a near-term result or achievement agency leadership wants to accomplish within approximately 24 months.</p>

In a new op-ed, Beth Angerman, one of the implementation officials for the CAP Goal [Sharing Quality Services](https://www.performance.gov/CAP/CAP_goal_5.html), explained that the federal government can cut long-term costs and improve service by modernizing the way it runs payroll.

<div class="testimonial-blockquote">
Payroll modernization represents a tremendous opportunity for the government -- an opportunity that sits squarely at the intersection of the cross-agency priorities outlined in the <a href="https://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html">President's Management Agenda </a>: modernizing IT, sharing quality services, making better use of data, moving from low-value to high-value work and reimagining and maximizing the skills of the workforce we need for the future," Angerman wrote.

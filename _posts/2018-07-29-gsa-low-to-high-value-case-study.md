The [Presidentâ€™s Management Agenda (PMA)]({{  site.baseurl  }}/PMA/PMA.html) and [Shifting from Low-Value to High-Value Work]({{  site.baseurl  }}/CAP/CAP_goal_6.html) CAP goal are encouraging agencies to find ways to shift time, effort, and funding from burdensome requierments to high value, mission-oriented work. Agencies are streamlining and eliminating unnecessary reporting requirements, consolidating processes and functions across offices, using shared services, and introducing new technologies like robotics process automation.

The Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) in the General Services Administration (GSA) has taken a comprehensive approach to improve its structure, business management and processes, operations, and culture.

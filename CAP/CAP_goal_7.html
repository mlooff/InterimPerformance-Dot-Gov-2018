meaning that they share in contracts that get the
best value for taxpayers, in order to buy common
goods and services as an enterprise. This
approach will eliminate redundancies, increase
efficiency, and deliver more value and savings
from Federal acquisition programs.</p>
<p>By the end of FY 2020, the Government will
achieve $18 billion in savings for taxpayers by
applying category management principals—or
smart decision-making where agencies buy the
same kinds of goods and services through best
value contract solutions—to 60% of common
spend.<sup>1</sup> In addition, the Government will reduce
duplicative contracts by 50,000, potentially
reducing administrative costs by hundreds of
millions of dollars.</p>

 on common goods and services every year. However, because agencies buy in a fragmented manner, taxpayers often do not get the benefit of the Government’s position as the largest
buyer in the world. Hundreds—and in some cases thousands—of duplicative contracts are awarded to the same vendors for similar requirements.
This fragmentation leads agencies to pay significantly different prices—sometimes varying
by over 300%<sup>3</sup>—for the same items.  </p>

            <h2>High-Impact Service Providers</h2>
<p>High-Impact Service Providers are those Federal entities designated by OMB that provide the most high-impact customer-facing services, either due to a large customer base or a high impact on those served by the program. A HISP is one that interacts with the public to provide a transactional service or perform a regulatory function in which time, money, or information is used to receive a good, service, or authorization. Below is a list of HISPs that will be reviewed and updated periodically by OMB.<p>

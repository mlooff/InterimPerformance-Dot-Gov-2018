      <h1>Elimination of Unnecessary Agency Reports</h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Federal agencies must comply with thousands of statutorily-mandated reporting obligations each year. Too often, these requirements persist over time despite changes to the circumstances they were intended to address. Time, money, and energy is lost complying with outdated, redundant, and unnecessary requirements that could be better spent accomplishing high-value objectives. Through the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010, Congress requires Federal agencies to identify for elimination or modification congressionally-required plans and reports that are outdated or duplicative. </p>
      <p>With the release of the FY 2019 Presidentâ€™s Budget, Federal agencies have identified 407 congressionally-required plans and reports proposed for elimination or modification. This list is the result of agency review and resubmission of 201 proposals previously published in 2012, 2014, and 2016, in addition to 206 new proposals identified this year. The list does not include prior proposals on which Congress has already <a href="https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ188/PLAW-113publ188.pdf">acted</a>, or that Federal agencies have concluded are no longer outdated or duplicative. <a href="../elimination/Final_Burden_Reduction_FY2019_Report.pdf"><u>Download the full list here</u></a>.</p>

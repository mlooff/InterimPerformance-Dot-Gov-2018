<h1>About Performance.gov</h1>
<p>Performance.gov is a window into Federal agencies’ efforts to deliver a smarter, leaner, and more effective government. This site fulfills the statutory requirements for an online centralized performance reporting portal required by the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act of 2010. The site provides the public, agencies, members of Congress, and the media a view into the progress underway to cut waste, streamline government, and improve performance.  <p>
<p>Performance.gov allows the public to learn more about the President’s Management Agenda (PMA), the Federal performance management framework, and the federal goal-setting process for driving progress in key management areas and priorities. The Federal Government uses the framework to manage Federal performance and achieve the vision set out in the PMA. <p>
<p>Performance.gov communicates the goals and objectives the Federal Government is working to accomplish, how it seeks to accomplish those goals, and why these efforts are important. All cabinet departments and nine other major agencies have agency pages on Performance.gov. Each agency’s page provides an overview of the agency, its mission, priority goals to be achieved, and links to its strategic and performance plans and reports.</p>
<p>We invite you to use Performance.gov to discover how government is working for the American public.</p>
<h2>Future of Performance.gov</h2>
<p> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and General Services Administration (GSA) are in the process of developing a vision and long-term strategy for a more sustainable, user-friendly Performance.gov that will offer easier navigation in addition to an online platform for improved access to performance data to better serve stakeholders' needs. The current website is an interim site until the new Performance.gov launches. You may visit the
 <a href="https://github.com/18F/performance.gov" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> to follow the progress on this effort.</p>

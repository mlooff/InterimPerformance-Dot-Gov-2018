<h3>Help Wanted: Increase the Effectiveness of your Tax Dollar!</h3>
<i>By Margaret M. Weichert, Deputy Director for Management, Office of Management and Budget</i>
<p>The Federal government spends at least $90 billion annually on IT. The announcement of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/PMA/PMA.html">President’s Management Agenda</a> included a <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/CAP/CAP_goal_10.html">cross-agency priority goal</a> specifically focused on increasing transparency in spend and performance metrics associated with IT across the enterprise. The adoption of the Technology Business Management (TBM) Framework will provide more granularity in IT investments based upon an open-source taxonomy broadly accepted across both private and public sector organizations. The effort will help Federal executives to make data-driven decisions and analyze trade-offs between cost, quality and value when allocating valuable tax payer dollars to support IT initiatives.</p>
<p>To help further TBM’s success in government, we are inviting the Technology marketplace to participate in designing the solution with us. Today, we’ve announced the formal start of market research to solicit ideas from interested parties to help the Federal government efficiently aggregate and analyze technology and business process data across the enterprise. We encourage interested parties to review publicly-available government data sources and identify the challenges, gaps, or benefits are of using these data sources to capture federal IT spend in the TBM taxonomy.</p>
<p>Our goal is to gather information around existing capabilities to automate the collection of data from multiple, disparate sources of data containing both structured and unstructured data elements to support the preparation and adoption of standard taxonomies in large organizations. The tools and/or services to be presented should include the latest capabilities in advanced data analytics and business intelligence to support the adoption of each layer identified within the TBM framework.</p>
<p>Improving IT spending transparency represents a tremendous opportunity for the government – an opportunity that sits squarely at the intersection of the cross-agency priorities outlined in the President’s Management Agenda: Modernize IT to Increase Productivity and Security, Sharing Quality Services, Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset, Shifting from Low-Value to High-Value Work, and Developing a Workforce for the 21st Century.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fbo.gov/notices/2f70b2e4a2cb05c8bae0a4acf693b807" target="_blank">The complete announcement can be found on FedBizOpps.</a> Interested parties are invited to register to participate in a Virtual Industry event (Tuesday, June 26). The event will offer the opportunity to hear additional details regarding the intention of the Federal government to leverage TBM to drive IT transparency, and ask on-line questions on the information in the announcement. Requirements are also provided for interested parties to participate in a Reverse Industry day to be held in July. This multi-day event will give interested parties the opportunity to demonstrate capabilities that exist for software and/or service solutions to support this effort.</p>
<p>
We encourage interested parties to participate and help the government usher in a new era of accountability!

        <h3>Op-Ed: Federal Payroll Modernization Could Advance President's Management Agenda and Cross-Agency Priority Goals</h3>
        <p>In a new op-ed, Beth Angerman, one of the implementation officials for the CAP Goal <a href="../CAP/CAP_goal_5.html">Sharing Quality Services</a>, explained that the federal government can cut long-term costs and improve service by modernizing the way it runs payroll.</p>
        <p>"Payroll modernization represents a tremendous opportunity for the government -- an opportunity that sits squarely at the intersection of the cross-agency priorities outlined in the <a href="../PMA/PMA.html">President's Management Agenda</a>: modernizing IT, sharing quality services, making better use of data, moving from low-value to high-value work and reimagining and maximizing the skills of the workforce we need for the future," Angerman wrote.</p>

<p>More than 200 federal C-suite leaders gathered in early April to better understand the <a href="http://www.performance.gov/PMA/PMA.html">President’s Management Agenda (PMA)</a> and how they can individually and collectively move it forward. Event participants included leaders for six of the Cross-Agency Priority (CAP) Goals that drive implementation of the PMA.</p>
<p>“The President’s Management Agenda sets out a roadmap for the way ahead. It’s an important step forward along this path because we don’t accomplish anything without leadership’s buy-in and engagement,” said Karen Dunn Kelley, who leads a CAP goal focused on “Leveraging Data as a Strategic Asset.”</p>
<p>Kelley underscored the importance of the CAP goal leaders’ roles. “We come from very diverse organizations with different missions, but taken together it is us that the American people rely on to deliver the critical missions of the federal government, provide excellent customer service, and manage our precious tax dollars.”</p>

  <h3>OMB Launches President’s Management Agenda and Kansas City Listening Tour</h3>
  <p><em>Kansas City, MO</em> – Today, the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) kicked off a two-day listening tour to engage federal workers and citizens in discussions about improving government services. Hosting several events in the greater Kansas City area, which is home to nearly 50,000 federal employees,  the listening tour was led by OMB’s Deputy Director of Management <b>Margaret Weichert</b>, and federal leaders, Government Services Administration (GSA) Administrator <b>Emily Murphy</b>, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director <b>Dr. Jeff Pon</b> and Federal Chief Information Officer <b>Suzette Kent</b>.</p>

  <p>In addition to the tour, Ms. Weichert unveiled the <a href="../PMA/PMA.html">President’s Management Agenda (PMA)</a>, the Administration’s strategy and long-term vision for modernizing the federal government. Through holistic efforts, the PMA focuses on better supporting three key areas of mission, service, and stewardship of government resources. PMA implementation will drive change through modern information technology, data accountability and transparency, and a modern workforce.</p>
<p><em>“We know that the public is frustrated with government’s perceived inability to deliver quality services for the American people,” said Ms. Weichert. “Through the President’s Management Agenda, this Administration is showing its commitment to modernizing Government, eliminating antiquated processes. This listening tour reflects the Administration’s understanding that transformational change starts with listening to citizens and agencies and aligning government services to meet those 21st century needs.”</em></p>
<p>For the first time, the President’s Management Agenda was presented outside of Washington, D.C. Kansas City was chosen because it is home to a large federal workforce and is an important hub of future federal innovation.

        <h3>Agencies Establish Revised Strategic Plans and Agency Priority Goals with the President's FY 2019 Budget</h3>
        <p>Federal agencies today published updated Strategic Plans spanning 2018-2022, and established Agency Priority Goals (APGs) to be achieved over the course of 2018-2019. Set at the beginning of each new term of an Administration, the Agency Strategic Plan defines the agency’s mission, presents the long-term goals objectives an agency hopes to accomplish, strategies planned, and the approaches it will use to monitor its progress in addressing specific national problems, needs, challenges, and opportunities related to its mission.
        <p> A goal accountability structure of the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, agency leaders set approximately 4 to 5 APGs every two years. These goals reflect the top priorities of Agency leadership, are aligned with the Administration’s priorities, results-oriented, implementation-focused, and measurable.  Per the GPRA Modernization Act, Agency Chief Operating Officers or Deputy Secretaries regularly review progress towards achieving their APGs with quarterly performance updates posted to this site. </p>
        <!--<p> With publication of the FY 2019 Budget, the Administration also released the framework for the Trump Administration’s President’s Management Agenda, outlining key government-wide management reform priorities and initiatives the Administration will seek to tackle over the next four years. In March, the Administration will announce more specific efforts to advance progress on the President’s Management Agenda, including senior accountable officials, concrete goals, and trackable metrics to ensure public accountability.<p/>

      <h2 id="section-heading-h2">Mission</h2>
      <p>The mission of the U.S. Department of Transportation is to ensure our Nation has the safest, most efficient and modern transportation system in the world, which improves the quality of life for all American people and communities, from rural to urban, and increases the productivity and competitiveness of American workers and businesses.</p><p>
      </p><h2 id="section-heading-h2">Overview</h2>
      <p>The establishment of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) in 1967 combined 31 disparate elements of the Federal Government with transportation responsibilities under one Department. The purpose of establishing the Department was to coordinate and administer Federal transportation programs; provide leadership in the identification and resolution of transportation problems; encourage cooperation of Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments toward the achievement of national transportation objectives; stimulate technological advances in transportation; and develop national transportation policies and programs.  </p>
<p>Today, DOT is responsible for overseeing and administering a wide range of transportation programs, policies and regulations for both aviation and surface transportation. The top priorities at DOT are to keep the traveling public safe and secure, increase their mobility, and have our transportation system contribute to the nation&apos;s economic growth.
